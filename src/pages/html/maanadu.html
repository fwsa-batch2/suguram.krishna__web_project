        Silambarasan. Madhan Karky was brought in to pen lyrics for all the songs in the soundtrack album. Producer
        Suresh Kamatchi initially announced that the first single of the film would be released on 14 May 2021, during

        release had been postponed indefinitely,[80] and Suresh Kamatchi assured fans to co-operate and planned to
        release the single post-lockdown.On 9 June 2021, Yuvan Shankar Raja tweeted that he bought the film's audio
        rights under his own label U1 Records and also announced that the single would be released on the occasion of
