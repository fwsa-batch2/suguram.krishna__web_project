            The music for the film will be composed by D. Imman, collaborating with actor Rajinikanth for the first
            time,
            and featured lyrics written by Thamarai, Viveka, Yugabharathi, Arun Bharathi, Mani Amuthavan and Arivu.
            Veteran singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, had recorded an introduction song for Rajinikanth in the film, which
            marks his last song before his death on 25 September 2020. In an interview with Sudhir Srinivasan
            of The New Indian Express, Imman said that "Fans expect certain factors from Rajinikanth's songs. On the
            other
            hand, I want the album to carry my identity as well. I have to cater to both. In addition to that, Rajini
            sir is
            acting in a full-fledged rural entertainer after a while. So, the Annatthe album should justify all these
            aspects". He said that the opening track, sung by SPB was considered to be the "best-ever opening song" for
            Rajinikanth.
        </p><br>

            Apart from SPB, other singers who crooned the songs from the music album were Sid Sriram, Shreya Ghoshal,
            Anirudh Ravichander, Diwakar and the composer Imman himself. The soundtrack was reported to feature about
            five songs and a theme music; totally six tracks in the soundtrack album, and has varied genres â€” opening
            song,
            melody, dance and festive numbers. Sun Pictures had planned to withhold the audio rights, along with the
            satellite and digital rights of the film and had planned to release the entire soundtrack through the
            company's
            music label Sun Audio.
